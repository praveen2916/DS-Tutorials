<h1> Javascript Excercise </h1>

This is a demonstration of Object oriented Programming using Javascript.  Here the problem statement is modelled into objects and 
fucntionality for the objects are created within the classes.  

The functionality required for the webpage to perform is then called appropriately from respective classes and sequentially put together
to form a coherent webpage.

The webpage performs following action on execution.

1.  There is a rectangle that acts as a on/off switch.
2.  On clicking the rectangle one can through MousePress add Bubbles.
3.  On rolling over a bubble the bubble is highlighted (color of bubble changes).
4.  The bubbles move around randomly and upon intersection with one another light up (color of bubble changes).
5.  When the bubble number reaches 10, the screen no longer accepts the new bubbles.
6.  After having 10 bubbles on screen, on further clicking the bubbles the bubbles are removed.  (removing from array by clicks)
7.  Any time during the steps 1-6, I can click the rectangle and start over.ï»¿
